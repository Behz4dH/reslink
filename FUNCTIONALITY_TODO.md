# Reslink Functionality Implementation TODO

## üìã **Complete Feature Implementation Roadmap**

### 1. **Database Integration for Real Data Storage**
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Replace mock data with actual database records
- [ ] Choose database solution (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- [ ] Design database schema for reslinks table
- [ ] Set up database connection and configuration
- [ ] Create database models/schemas
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- [ ] Replace mock data imports with real API calls
- [ ] Add database migrations and seeding
- [ ] Test database integration with existing UI

**Technical Considerations:**
- Database choice depends on deployment preferences
- Need to handle database initialization and migrations
- Consider using an ORM like Prisma, TypeORM, or Mongoose
- Database schema should include: id, title, name, position, company, createdDate, videoUrl, resumeUrl, status, viewCount, lastViewed

### 2. **Enhanced Teleprompter with Larger Recording Box & Slower Text Speed**
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Improve teleprompter UX for better video recording experience
- [ ] Analyze current teleprompter component structure
- [ ] Increase recording box size (viewport dimensions)
- [ ] Implement adjustable text scrolling speed controls
- [ ] Add text speed slider/controls for user customization
- [ ] Test recording quality with larger dimensions
- [ ] Ensure text remains readable at slower speeds
- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality for text scrolling
- [ ] Test with different screen sizes for responsiveness

**Technical Considerations:**
- Current teleprompter uses `Teleprompter.tsx` component
- May need to adjust CSS dimensions and scrolling animations
- Consider adding user preferences storage for speed settings

### 3. **Google Drive Video Upload Integration**
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Replace local video storage with Google Drive uploads
- [ ] Research Google Drive API v3 integration methods
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud Console project and enable Drive API
- [ ] Implement Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- [ ] Create Google Drive upload functionality
- [ ] Handle video file upload progress and status
- [ ] Store Google Drive file IDs in database instead of local paths
- [ ] Implement video sharing permissions (public/restricted access)
- [ ] Add error handling for upload failures
- [ ] Test upload performance and file size limits

**Implementation Approaches:**
**Option A - Client-side Upload:**
- Use Google Drive API directly from browser
- Pros: Direct upload, no server storage needed
- Cons: Requires user Google account, API keys exposed

**Option B - Server-side Upload:**
- Upload to server first, then server uploads to Drive
- Pros: More secure, controlled access
- Cons: Requires server storage temporarily, more complex

**Option C - Signed URLs:**
- Generate signed upload URLs from server
- Pros: Secure, direct upload, no temp storage
- Cons: More complex authentication flow

**Recommendation:** Start with Option B for security, move to Option C for production

### 4. **Reslink Badge PDF Integration**
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Add clickable badge to resume PDFs that links to video pitches
- [ ] Analyze reslink-badge.png design requirements
- [ ] Choose PDF manipulation library (PDF-lib, jsPDF, etc.)
- [ ] Design badge component (blue button with "üìò View Reslink")
- [ ] Implement PDF badge insertion functionality
- [ ] Create unique tracking URLs for each badge click
- [ ] Position badge appropriately on resume (top-right corner)
- [ ] Ensure badge doesn't interfere with resume content
- [ ] Test badge across different PDF viewers
- [ ] Make badge responsive to different PDF sizes

**Technical Implementation:**
- Use PDF-lib for client-side PDF manipulation
- Badge should be clickable and link to: `https://reslink.app/view/[unique-id]`
- Badge design: Blue background, white "üìò View Reslink" text
- Position: Top-right corner with small margin
- Size: Approximately 100x30px

**Badge URL Structure:**
```
https://reslink.app/view/[reslink-id]?recruiter=[hashed-identifier]
```

### 5. **Recruiter Engagement Tracking System**
**Status:** ‚ùå Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Description:** Track when recruiters view videos via resume badge clicks
- [ ] Create unique tracking URLs for each reslink badge
- [ ] Implement click tracking endpoint/API
- [ ] Design recruiter identification system (anonymous but unique)
- [ ] Create video viewing page for recruiters
- [ ] Update database with view timestamps and recruiter data
- [ ] Add engagement analytics to dashboard
- [ ] Create "Recently Viewed" section in dashboard table
- [ ] Implement view count and last viewed date display
- [ ] Add recruiter engagement notifications
- [ ] Create engagement analytics dashboard

**Database Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Add to reslinks table
ALTER TABLE reslinks ADD COLUMN view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE reslinks ADD COLUMN last_viewed TIMESTAMP;

-- New table for detailed analytics
CREATE TABLE reslink_views (
  id PRIMARY KEY,
  reslink_id FOREIGN KEY,
  viewer_identifier STRING, -- anonymous but trackable
  viewed_at TIMESTAMP,
  ip_address STRING,
  user_agent STRING,
  referrer STRING
);
```

**Analytics Features:**
- View count per reslink
- Last viewed timestamp
- Unique viewer tracking
- View history timeline
- Geographic analytics (optional)
- Popular viewing times

## üéØ **Implementation Order Recommendation:**

1. **Start with Database Integration** (Foundation for everything)
2. **Google Drive Integration** (Core functionality)
3. **PDF Badge System** (User-facing feature)
4. **Engagement Tracking** (Analytics and insights)
5. **Teleprompter Improvements** (UX enhancement)
